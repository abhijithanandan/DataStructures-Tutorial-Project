	Data Structuring 
		----- DATA TYPE, OPERATIONS
		----- DATA-PPROCEDURE ENCAPSULATION
		----- DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURING

	Algorithm Expression
		----- CONTROL STRUCTURES
		----- FUNCTIONS, RECURSIVE FUNCTIONS (A function that call itself)

	Functions
		----- Subrouties are same as functions in C
		----- When we pass args to a fuction, the function parameters within the funciton are new vaiables
		----- So if we need the acutal values of the agruments to be modified then we should pass them by reference.
		----- There are two segments for each function: 
			----- CODE SEGMENT 
			----- DATA SEGMENT
		----- To see how functions vaibles are dynamically allocated on the stack from the CODE SEGMENT, check Intordution/Funcitons-Data-Stacking.png
		----- There are certain vaibales in C which exist in the CODE SEGMENT rather than DATA SEGMENT
